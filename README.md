# MERN E-Commerce Project

This project is a **practice E-Commerce web application** built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js).

The goal of this project was not to write perfectly polished code, but to **test my ability to understand, merge, and manipulate different codebases**. I combined three smaller projects ‚Äî all of which I built mostly from scratch without relying on component libraries like _shadcn/ui_ or AI agents ‚Äî into a single application, then extended it with new features like authentication, filtering, and a cart system.

Each of those three projects followed different architectures, and only one of them used TypeScript while the others did not. Because of this, the final merged project has an intentionally **inconsistent codebase**. This was a deliberate exercise to demonstrate that I can adapt to and work with different coding styles, structures, and technologies while still delivering a functional product.
